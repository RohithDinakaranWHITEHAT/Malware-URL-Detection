# Malware URL Detection Project

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based model capable of detecting malicious URLs. These URLs can be used for phishing, malware distribution, and other cyber-attacks. The project aims to enhance cybersecurity by providing a tool to identify and mitigate threats posed by such URLs.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of URLs labeled as either benign or malicious. Each URL is associated with a set of features that describe various characteristics, such as the presence of an IP address, length of the URL, number of special characters, and the presence of suspicious keywords.

## Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is a crucial step in this project. The following features were extracted from each URL:
- **use_of_ip**: Whether the URL contains an IP address.
- **abnormal_url**: Whether the hostname appears in the URL.
- **count.**: Number of dots in the URL.
- **count-www**: Occurrence of 'www' in the URL.
- **count@**: Occurrence of '@' in the URL.
- **count_dir**: Number of directories in the URL path.
- **count_embed_domian**: Number of embedded domains in the URL.
- **short_url**: Whether the URL uses a shortening service.
- **count-https**: Occurrence of 'https' in the URL.
- **count-http**: Occurrence of 'http' in the URL.
- **count%**: Occurrence of '%' in the URL.
- **count?**: Occurrence of '?' in the URL.
- **count-**: Occurrence of '-' in the URL.
- **count=**: Occurrence of '=' in the URL.
- **url_length**: Length of the URL.
- **hostname_length**: Length of the hostname.
- **sus_url**: Presence of suspicious keywords (e.g., PayPal, login).
- **fd_length**: Length of the first directory in the URL path.
- **tld_length**: Length of the top-level domain.
- **count-digits**: Number of digits in the URL.
- **count-letters**: Number of letters in the URL.

## Model Training
A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier was chosen for this task. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The model was trained using features extracted from the URLs and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.

## Model Performance
The MLP classifier achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:
- **Accuracy**: 0.953
- **Recall**: 0.929
- **Precision**: 0.975
- **F1 Score**: 0.952

## Deployment
The trained model was deployed using a Python script, allowing for real-time detection of malicious URLs. The deployment script:
1. Accepts a URL as input.
2. Extracts features from the URL.
3. Uses the trained model to predict whether the URL is benign or malicious.
4. Displays the prediction result using the `pyfiglet` library for visual enhancement.

## Usage
To use the malware detection tool, run the script with the URL to be checked as an argument. For example:
```sh
python malware_detector.py http://login-secure-update.com/account/signin?sessionid=12345&user=admin
